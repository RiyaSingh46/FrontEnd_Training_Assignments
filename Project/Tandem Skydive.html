        <h5 style="font-weight: bold;">Tandem skydiving is an introduction to the sport of skydiving. The Tandem Student wears a harness 
        that connects to the Tandem Instructor who wears the parachute.</h5>
        <p></p>
        <p>Together the tandem pair jump out of a plane usually between 10,000 to 15,000 feet above the ground. They freefall for up to one minute and then the Tandem Instructor opens the parachute and steers it back to the ground.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>You can tandem skydive in Australia over spectacular beaches, outback panoramas, tropical rainforest and everything in between!</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>It's the ultimate, must-do experience for anyone with a sense of adventure.</p>

            <h5 id="h5">CLOTHING</h5>    
            <p>We recommend comfortable loose clothing with fully enclosed shoes, such as running or sports trainers. Hiking boots and high heels are not appropriate.</p>
        
            <i class="bi bi-award"></i>
            <h5 id="h5">GET A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP</h5>
            <p>Preparing for your first skydive is easy enough: in short, don't do anything differently. Waking up and eating breakfast as you normally would is a good start.&nbsp;</p>
        
            <i class="bi bi-emoji-sunglasses"></i>
            <h5 id="h5">REMEMBER TO BRING YOUR GLASSES</h5>
            <p>Or contact lenses, if you need them. All skydiving centres provide over-the-glasses goggles for skydivers, so you can thoroughly enjoy the views.</p>

            <h5 id="h5">INVITE YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY</h5>
            <p>Skydiving is a spectator sport. Many skydiving centres have dedicated spectator viewing areas.</p>

            <h3>Medical Considerations</h3>
            <p>All participants should be in good health and physical condition and should not be on medication which could affect judgment or performance. Before scheduling a jump, check with the local drop zoneâ€™s weight requirements.</p>
            <h3>
                What to expect on a tandem skydive
            </h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        After a short briefing you will be fitted into a harness.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The plane ride will take between 10 to 30 minutes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Your instructor will connect you to the front of their parachute system before exiting the aircraft.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Freefall can last up to one minute - the higher you go the longer the freefall!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You can reach speeds over 200km/h towards the ground in freefall!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Your Tandem Instructor opens the parachute and steers it to the landing area.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Weight restrictions</h3>
            <p>Weight restrictions apply - consult your drop zone for further details.</p>
            <h3>Age restrictions</h3>
            <p>
                The minimum age requirement is 16 years old (with parental or guardian consent). There is no upper age limit - you're never too old to jump from a plane!
            </p>
            <h3>Are my instructors qualified?</h3>
            <p>
                Tandem Instructors working in Australia are all qualified and have a minimum of 500 skydives.
            </p>
            <h3>Can I bring my own GoPro on my skydive?</h3>
            <p>
                Absolutely - once you have done at least 100 skydives, hold a Certificate Class C and have received training on camera hazards that is. This is an APF rule and there are no exceptions. All skydiving centres offer professional in-air videography by qualified instructors and camera flyers.
